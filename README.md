### Overview
This Github repo contains all of the resources required for my SDV701 Assignment Stage 2
<br />
<br />
This assignment was a multi-tier software development project using a fictional writing collective (The writers collective) as a use case for the 3 separate applications required. 
The 3 applications used the Client Server Model to share data and functionality, the different application types used were
<ul>
  <li>A .Net console application providing REST API Routes (Server)</li>
  <li>A .Net windows form application for administration of authors, books and orders (Client)</li>
  <li>A Ionic/Angular Web application for viewing books and creating orders</li>
</ul>
