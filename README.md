# SDV701 Assignment Stage 2
By Callum McFadgen

### Overview
This Github repo contains all of the resources required for my SDV701 Assignment Stage 2
<br />
<br />
This assignment was a multi-tier software development project using a fictional writing collective (The writers collective) as a use case for the 3 separate applications required. 
The 3 applications used the Client Server Model to share data and functionality, the different application types used were
<ul>
  <li>A .Net console application providing REST API Routes (Server)</li>
  <li>A .Net windows form application for administration of authors, books and orders (Client)</li>
  <li>A Ionic/Angular Web application for viewing books and creating orders (Client)</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

### Features
The .Net console application provides an interface with a SQL Sever database file containing a small relational database with 3 tables (Author, Book and Book_Order) to support the assignment requirements.  
<br />
This data base is included in this repo in the database folder, including a copy of the create and insert SQL queries used to build and populate the test database
