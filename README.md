# SDV701 Assignment Stage 2
By Callum McFadgen

### Overview
This Github repo contains all of the resources required for my SDV701 Assignment Stage 2
<br />
<br />
This assignment was a multi-tier software development project using a fictional writing collective (The writers collective) as a use case for the 3 separate applications required. 
The 3 applications used the Client Server Model to share data and functionality, the different application types used were
<ul>
  <li>A .Net console application providing REST API Routes (Server)</li>
  <li>A .Net windows form application (Client)</li>
  <li>A Ionic/Angular Web application (Client)</li>
</ul>
<br />

### Features
The .Net console application provides an interface with a SQL Sever database, this interface is available to multiple Client applications and provides a range of REST APIs that can be accessed by Client application, to use a range of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods.
<br />
<br />
The .Net windows forms application provides a range of administration functions, allowing the user (the writers collective admin) to view authors, view, edit and delete books and view and delete orders.
<br />
<br />
The Angular application provides some simple customer functions, allowing the user (a member of the public) to view authors and their books and to create and dispatch orders for purchasing books.
<br />
<br />
All of these applications have been tested, demonstrated and have meet the assignment requirements.  They have been quite robust, with only one or two small bugs.
